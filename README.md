MacOS Tahoe removed launchpad,and it's so hard to use, it's doesn't use your Bio GPU, please apple, at least give people an option to switch back. Before that, here is LaunchNext

*Built upon [LaunchNow](https://github.com/ggkevinnnn/LaunchNow) by ggkevinnnn - huge thanks to the original project!❤️*

*LaunchNow has chosen the GPL 3 license. LaunchNext follows the same licensing terms.*

### Install with Homebrew 🍺

```bash
brew tap RoversX/homebrew-tap
brew install --cask launchnext
```

LaunchNext includes its own updater. The Homebrew cask is mainly for installation and manual upgrades.

⚠️ **If macOS blocks the app, run this in Terminal:**
```bash
sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/LaunchNext.app
```
**Why**: I can't afford Apple's developer certificate ($99/year), so macOS blocks unsigned apps. This command removes the quarantine flag to let it run. **Only use this command on apps you trust.**

### What LaunchNext Delivers
- ✅ **One-click import from old system Launchpad** - directly reads your native Launchpad SQLite database (`/private$(getconf DARWIN_USER_DIR)com.apple.dock.launchpad/db/db`) to perfectly recreate your existing folders, app positions, and layout
- ✅ **Classic Launchpad experience** - works exactly like the beloved original interface
- ✅ **Multi-language support** - full internationalization with English, Chinese, Japanese, French, Spanish, German, Russian, and more
- ✅ **Hide icon labels** - clean, minimalist view when you don't need app names
- ✅ **Custom icon sizes** - adjust icon dimensions to fit your preferences
- ✅ **Smart folder management** - create and organize folders just like before
- ✅ **Fuzzy search and keyboard navigation** - find apps quickly, even with partial or imperfect input
- ✅ **CLI / TUI support** - inspect and operate your layout from the terminal
- ✅ **Hot Corner and native gesture support** - open LaunchNext with corners, trackpad gestures, and 4 / 5 finger options
- ✅ **Drag apps directly to the Dock** - available in Next Engine + Core Animation
- ✅ **Core Animation folders** - folder content supports paged and vertical scroll layouts
- ✅ **Better context menus** - Show in Finder, Copy App Path, Rename Folder, and configured uninstall actions
- ✅ **Update tab with Markdown release notes** - richer in-app update experience
- ✅ **Backup, controller, and voice support improvements** - better reliability and accessibility

### What We Lost in macOS Tahoe
- ❌ No custom app organization
- ❌ No user-created folders
- ❌ No drag-and-drop customization
- ❌ No visual app management
- ❌ Forced categorical grouping


### Data Storage
Application data is safely stored in:
```
~/Library/Application Support/LaunchNext/Data.store
```

### Native Launchpad Integration
Reads directly from the system Launchpad database:
```bash
/private$(getconf DARWIN_USER_DIR)com.apple.dock.launchpad/db/db
```

## Installation

### Requirements
- macOS 26 (Tahoe) or later
- Apple Silicon or Intel processor
- Xcode 26 (for building from source)

### Build from Source

   ```

2. **Open in Xcode**
   ```bash

   ```

3. **Build and run**
   - Select your target device
   - Press `⌘+R` to build and run
   - Or `⌘+B` to build only

### Command Line Build

**Regular Build:**
```bash
xcodebuild -project LaunchNext.xcodeproj -scheme LaunchNext -configuration Release
```

**Universal Binary Build (Intel + Apple Silicon):**
```bash
xcodebuild -project LaunchNext.xcodeproj -scheme LaunchNext -configuration Release ARCHS="arm64 x86_64" ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=NO clean build
```

## Usage

### Getting Started

3. **Search**: Type to instantly filter applications
4. **Organize**: Drag apps to create folders and custom layouts
5. **Automate**: Enable CLI in Settings if you want terminal workflows

### Import Your Launchpad

2. Click **"Import Launchpad"**
3. Your existing layout and folders are automatically imported

- **Fullscreen**: Full-screen mode for maximum visibility
- **Legacy Engine** and **Next Engine + Core Animation** are available in Settings
- LaunchNext can keep separate settings for fullscreen and compact
- Optional fullscreen menu bar hiding is available; macOS also hides the Dock when this is enabled

## Advanced Features

### Search and Folder Experience
- **Fuzzy Search**: Match apps with partial names, abbreviations, and imperfect input
- **Configurable Search Delay**: Tune search debounce timing in Settings
- **Folder Layout Modes**: Choose between Launchpad-like paged folders and vertical scrolling folders
- **Core Animation Folder Rendering**: Smoother folder interaction for larger folders

### Smart Background Interaction

- **Lazy Loading**: Efficient memory usage
- **Background Scanning**: Non-blocking app discovery

### Automation and Activation
- **CLI / TUI**: Manage LaunchNext from the terminal
- **Hot Corner**: Open LaunchNext from a configurable screen corner
- **Experimental native gestures**: 4 / 5 finger pinch and tap actions, including external trackpad device selection
- **Dock drag**: Drag apps directly into the macOS Dock in Next Engine + Core Animation

### App Management
- **Context menu actions**: Show apps in Finder, copy app paths, rename folders, and use a configured uninstall tool

### Update and Backup Tools
- **Update tab**: Check for updates and read Markdown release notes inside Settings
- **Backup tools**: Create and restore backups more safely
- **Notification update**: Modern notification API support

### Multi-Display Support
- Automatic screen detection

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: App won't start?**
A: Ensure macOS 26.0+ and check system permissions.

**Q: Which engine should I use?**
A: `Next Engine + Core Animation` is recommended for the best experience. `Legacy Engine` is still available if you need the older compatibility path.

**Q: Why doesn't the CLI command exist yet?**
A: Enable the command line interface in Settings first. LaunchNext can install and remove the managed `launchnext` command for you.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Development Guidelines
- Follow Swift style conventions
- Add meaningful comments for complex logic
- Test on multiple macOS versions
- Maintain backward compatibility

## The Future of App Management

As Apple moves away from customizable interfaces, LaunchNext represents a push toward user control and personalization. I still hope Apple brings Launchpad back.

**LaunchNext** isn't just a Launchpad replacement—it's a statement that user choice matters.
